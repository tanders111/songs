Heart Break Hotel   Elvis Presley
---
I
Well since my baby left me
I've found a new place to dwell
Itâ€™s down at the end of lonely street
At heartbreak hotel

IV
and I get so lonely baby,

I get so lonely,
V                       I
I get so lonely I could die


I
Although its always crowded,
You still can find some room
For broken hearted lovers
To cry away their gloom

[chorus]

I
Well, the bellhop's tears keep flowing
The desk clerk's dressed in black
They've been so long on lonely street
They'll never, never, never get back

[chorus]

I
So if your baby leaves you
You've got a tale to tell
Just take a walk down lonely street
To heartbreak hotel

[chorus]
